# OData Query Objects

Q-Objects are building blocks which are generated by `odata2ts`.
They are the counterpart to the typescript model interfaces and allow for complex and powerful query semantics,
renaming and type conversion.

## Documentation
Main documentation for the odata2ts eco system:
[https://odata2ts.github.io](https://odata2ts.github.io/)

## Examples
See [example packages](https://github.com/odata2ts/odata2ts/tree/main/examples) for examples of how to integrate `odata2ts`.

## Inspiration

The base idea for "Query Objects" stems from [QueryDsl](http://www.querydsl.com/). 
[Jooq](https://www.jooq.org/) also works this way.
